# Azure Application Insights Agent Framework
The Azure Application Insights Agent Framework causes an application to be automatically configured to work with a bound [Azure Application Insights Service][].  **Note:** This framework is disabled by default.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Detection Criterion</strong></td><td>Existence of a single bound Azure Application Insights service.
      <ul>
        <li>Existence of a Azure Application Insights service is defined as the <a href="http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/environment-variable.html#VCAP-SERVICES"><code>VCAP_SERVICES</code></a> payload containing a service who's name, label or tag has <code>azure-application-insights</code> as a substring with at least `connection_string` or `instrumentation_key` set as credentials.</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Tags</strong></td>
    <td><tt>azure-application-insights=&lt;version&gt;</tt></td>
  </tr>
</table>
Tags are printed to standard output by the buildpack detect script

## User-Provided Service
Users must provide their own Azure Application Insights service. A user-provided Azure Application Insights service must have a name or tag with `azure-application-insights` in it so that the Azure Application Insights Agent Framework Framework will automatically configure the application to work with the service.

The credential payload of the service has to contain one of the following entries:

| Name | Description | Status |
| ---- | ----------- | ------ |
| `connection_string` | **REQUIRED** for agent version 3.x+. You can find your connection string in your Application Insights resource. | ✅ **Recommended** |
| `instrumentation_key` | Required for agent version 2.x. **⚠️ DEPRECATED in version 3.x** - switch to `connection_string` instead. | ⚠️ **Deprecated** |

### ⚠️ Deprecation Warning: instrumentation_key

**The `instrumentation_key` credential is deprecated** in Azure Application Insights agent version 3.x and later.

**Action Required**:
- **New deployments**: Use `connection_string` instead of `instrumentation_key`
- **Existing deployments**: Migrate to `connection_string` before upgrading to agent v3.x

**How to migrate**:
1. Get your connection string from your Application Insights resource in Azure Portal
2. Update your user-provided service credentials:
   ```bash
   cf update-user-provided-service my-app-insights -p '{"connection_string": "InstrumentationKey=xxx;IngestionEndpoint=https://..."}'
   ```
3. Restage your application:
   ```bash
   cf restage my-app
   ```

## Configuration
For general information on configuring the buildpack, including how to specify configuration values through environment variables, refer to [Configuration and Extension][].

### Default Configuration
The buildpack includes a default `AI-Agent.xml` configuration file that is embedded at compile time. This provides sensible defaults for Cloud Foundry deployments.

The default configuration file is located in `src/java/resources/files/azure_application_insights_agent/AI-Agent.xml`.

#### Customizing Default Configuration via Fork
To customize the default Azure Application Insights configuration across all applications using your buildpack:

1. Fork the java-buildpack repository
2. Modify the configuration file in `src/java/resources/files/azure_application_insights_agent/`
3. Build and package your custom buildpack
4. Upload the custom buildpack to your Cloud Foundry foundation

This approach is useful for operators who want to enforce organization-wide Azure Application Insights settings.
